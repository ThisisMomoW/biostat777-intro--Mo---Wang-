I completed my **BSc in Statistics at UCL (University College London)**, where I found an open, kind community， and plenty of chances to take day trips to towns around London.

In my free time I do **pilates**, **play golf** and **bake**

I also love to **travel**, when I was in the UK I visited **Spain** every vacation.

I’m a huge fan of **classical music** (let’s go to a concert!).  
Favorites: **Sergei Rachmaninoff** (composer), **Daniil Trifonov** (pianist) and **Daniel Lozakovich** (violinist).

Now in my first year at **JHU Biostatistics**, I’m exploring widely, with growing interests in **spatial data** and **causal inference**.

#### Fun facts
- Best day trip near London: **Winchester**.
- Comfort bake: **Matcha cheesecake**.
